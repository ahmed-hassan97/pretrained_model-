## To look out your model use this api in keras

                     model.summary()

## Description :point_left:

Building models for yourself is great, and can be very powerful. But, as you've seen, you can be limited by the data you have on

hand. Not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power that's needed to train them effectively.

Transfer learning can help solve this  where people with models trained on large datasets train them, so that you can either use

them directly, or, you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario. 

This is Transfer learning

## how-to-use :ear:

1- you should download pretrained model weight
